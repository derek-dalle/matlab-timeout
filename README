This MATLAB function is used to evaluate a function but with a given time
constraint.  Therefore the example

   >> [a, b] = timeout(f, 3, X, Y, Z)

is equivalent to evaluating

   >> [a, b] = f(X, Y, Z)

except that the first call will throw an error if the evaluation does not
complete before (approximately) 3 seconds.  Note that this function
relies on the Parallel Computing Toolbox, specifically the functions
BATCH and WAIT.  This incurs substatial overhead, so do not use it for
function calls that are expected to take less than 5 seconds or so.

If the evaluation contains an error, the traceback will probably contain
references to these functions and probably others.

Note that this syntax is very similar to the FEVAL function except with
an extra argument to specify the timeout constraint.  In other words,  the
following three commands are very similar except that the last one will
exit if it takes more than 3 seconds.

   >> [a, b] = f(X, Y, Z)
   >> [a, b] = feval(f, X, Y, Z)
   >> [a, b] = timeout(f, 3, X, Y, Z)

EXAMPLE:
The following example creates a function that creates a random
1000x1000 matrix and calculates the sine of it.  Depending on your
computer, some of the examples will successfully evaluate and others will
not complete in the allotted time.

   >> f = @() sin(rand(1000));   % creates the function
   >> a = timeout(f, 20);        % allows 20 seconds, should complete
   >> a = timeout(f, 1);         % cannot complete in 1 second
   Error using timeout (line 75)
   Evaluation timed out.
